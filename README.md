The most simple bot for day trading
It uses technical indicators to estimate when the best time to buy and sell crypto is
It will then use paper money (fake money) and make a purchase 
It will record said purchase in a text file where you can see the history

Update:
I uploaded some new trading bots. Some of the sources of data, technical indicators used and other factors.
I don't know which one works the best but again, none should be used to make financial decisions.
